    "# Overfitting and underfitting are common challenges in machine learning that affect the performance and generalization ability of models:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Overfitting:\n",
    "#   Overfitting occurs when a model learns to perform exceptionally well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data.\n",
    "# It essentially memorizes the training data and captures noise or random fluctuations, which results in poor performance on real-world data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Consequences:\n",
    "#   - High training accuracy, low test accuracy.\n",
    "#   - Poor generalization to new data.\n",
    "#   - Model is too complex and captures noise.\n",
    "   \n",
    "#   Mitigation Strategies:\n",
    "#   - Use more training data to expose the model to a wider range of examples.\n",
    "#   - Simplify the model by reducing its complexity (e.g., fewer layers in a neural network, lower polynomial degrees).\n",
    "#   - Regularization techniques like L1 or L2 regularization to penalize overly complex models.\n",
    "#   - Cross-validation to evaluate model performance on multiple validation sets.\n",
    "#   - Early stopping during training to prevent the model from becoming too specialized to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Underfitting:\n",
    "#   Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. It fails to learn important relationships, \n",

    "\n",
    "#   Consequences:\n",

    "#   - Experiment with different algorithms or hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Striking the right balance between overfitting and underfitting is crucial for building a model that performs well on unseen data. \n",
    "# This balance is often referred to as the \"bias-variance trade-off\":\n",
