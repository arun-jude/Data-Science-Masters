    "# Answer 1 -\n",
    "# Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "# The PMF is a function that gives the probability of each possible outcome of a discrete random variable. \n",
    "# It maps each value of the random variable to its corresponding probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# Consider rolling a fair six-sided die. The PMF of the random variable \"X\" (the outcome of the roll) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "# PMF(X = 1) = 1/6\n",
    "# PMF(X = 2) = 1/6\n",
    "# PMF(X = 3) = 1/6\n",
    "# PMF(X = 4) = 1/6\n",
    "# PMF(X = 5) = 1/6\n",
    "# PMF(X = 6) = 1/6\n",
    "# Here, the PMF tells us the probabilities of rolling each number on the die.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "# The PDF is a function that describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable falling within a certain range of values. Unlike the PMF, which assigns probabilities to specific values, the PDF provides probabilities for ranges of values.\n",

    "\n",
    "# The Cumulative Density Function (CDF) is a fundamental concept in probability and statistics. \n",
    "# It describes the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a given value. \n",
    "# In other words, the CDF gives you the cumulative probability distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mathematically, for a random variable X, the CDF is denoted as F(x) and is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "# F(x)=P(X<=x)\n",
    "\n",
    "# In the case of a discrete random variable, the CDF is the sum of the probabilities of all values less than or equal to x. \n",
    "# For a continuous random variable, the CDF is often expressed as an integral of the probability density function (PDF) up to x.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# Let's consider rolling a fair six-sided die again. The CDF for the outcome of the roll (X) can be calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "# For X = 1: F(1) = P(X <= 1) = 1/6\n",
    "# For X = 2: F(2) = P(X <= 2) = 2/6\n",
    "# For X = 3: F(3) = P(X <= 3) = 3/6\n",
    "# For X = 4: F(4) = P(X <= 4) = 4/6\n",
    "# For X = 5: F(5) = P(X <= 5) = 5/6\n",
    "# For X = 6: F(6) = P(X <= 6) = 6/6 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why CDF is used:\n",
    "# 1. Probability Calculation: The CDF provides a way to calculate the probability of a random variable falling within a certain range \n",
    "# or below a specific value.\n",
    "# 2. **Quantiles and Percentiles**: The CDF helps in finding quantiles (values that divide the distribution into specified proportions) \n",
    "# and percentiles (values that correspond to specific percent levels).\n",
    "# 3. Distribution Characteristics: The shape and behavior of the CDF reveal important information about the distribution of the random variable, \n",
    "# such as skewness, central tendency, and spread.\n",
    "# 4. Statistical Analysis: The CDF is used in hypothesis testing, confidence interval estimation, and other statistical procedures.\n",
    "# 5. Comparison: CDFs can be used to compare different distributions and assess their relative likelihoods."
