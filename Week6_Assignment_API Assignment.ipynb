    "# Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer 2 - Advantages and disadvantages of using API: -\n",
    "\n",
    "# Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Increased Interoperability: API solutions enable different software systems to communicate with each other, regardless of their programming language or platform.\n",
    "#    This enhances the interoperability between systems, allowing for the exchange of data and functionality.\n",
    "# 2. Improved Efficiency: API driven infrastructures enable developers to reuse code and functionality from existing software systems, \n",
    "#    saving time and reducing the amount of code that needs to be written from scratch.\n",
    "# 3. Better User Experience: APIs can enable third-party developers to create applications that integrate with existing software systems, \n",
    "#    providing a better user experience and increased functionality.\n",
    "# 4. Increased Flexibility: APIs provide developers with greater flexibility, enabling them to choose the best programming languages and frameworks for their needs.\n",
    "# 5. New Revenue Streams: APIs can enable companies to create new revenue streams by providing third-party developers with access to their software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Security Concerns: API infrastructures can be vulnerable to security breaches, such as SQL injection attacks and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks,\n",
    "#    making it crucial to implement security measures to protect against these threats.\n",
    "# 2. Complexity: APIs can be complex, requiring a significant amount of development effort to implement and maintain.\n",
    "# 3. Compatibility Issues: APIs can have compatibility issues between different versions of the same software system or between different systems, \n",
    "#    which can lead to errors and system failures.\n",
    "# 4. Dependency on Third-Party Developers: APIs rely on third-party developers to create applications that integrate with the software system. \n",
    "#    This can create dependencies that are outside of the control of the company that owns the software system.\n",
    "# 5. Governance and Management: APIs require proper governance and management to ensure they are being used correctly \n",
    "#    and consistently across different applications and systems."
