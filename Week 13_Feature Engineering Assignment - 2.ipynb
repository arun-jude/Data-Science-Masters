    "# Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer 1 -\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Filter method is a feature selection technique used in machine learning to select relevant features from a dataset before training a model.\n",
    "# It operates independently of the machine learning algorithm and focuses on evaluating the characteristics of individual features rather than \n",
    "# their interactions. The Filter method ranks and selects features based on statistical metrics or domain-specific criteria, without considering \n",
    "# the performance of a specific model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here's how the Filter method works:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Feature Ranking:\n",
    "#   In the Filter method, each feature is evaluated individually without considering the target variable. Different statistical or scoring metrics\n",
    "#   are applied to rank the features based on their relevance or significance. Common metrics include correlation, chi-squared, information gain, \n",
    "#   mutual information, variance, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Ranking Criteria:\n",
    "#   The choice of ranking metric depends on the type of data (numerical, categorical) and the problem at hand. For example, correlation might be \n",
    "#   suitable for numerical features, while chi-squared or mutual information might be used for categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Threshold Setting:\n",
    "#   After ranking the features, a threshold is set to determine which features will be selected. Features above the threshold are retained, \n",
    "#   while those below it are discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Feature Selection:\n",
    "#    The top-ranked features above the threshold are selected for model training. The idea is that features with higher ranks are more likely\n",
    "#    to contain relevant information for the prediction task.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Model Training:\n",
    "#    Once the feature selection is done, the selected features are used to train the machine learning model. The goal is to create a more compact\n",
    "#   and efficient model that focuses on the most informative features.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Advantages of the Filter Method:\n",
    "# - Simplicity: It's easy to implement and doesn't require building and training a model.\n",
    "# - Computational Efficiency: It's computationally less intensive compared to wrapper methods.\n",
    "# - Feature Independence: It evaluates features independently, which can be useful when feature interactions are less important.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Limitations of the Filter Method:\n",
    "# - Ignores Feature Dependencies: The Filter method doesn't consider feature interactions or dependencies, which could lead to suboptimal selections.\n",
    "# - Data Bias: It doesn't account for the target variable, so features with strong individual correlations might be selected even \n",
    "#  if they don't contribute much to the target prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Filter method is a quick and efficient way to perform initial feature selection, but it should be combined with other methods,\n",
    "# such as wrapper methods (e.g., recursive feature elimination) or embedded methods (e.g., regularization techniques), to ensure the best \n",
    "# subset of features is selected for optimal model performance."

    "# Answer 2 -\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Wrapper method and the Filter method are two different approaches to feature selection in machine learning. They have distinct \n",
    "# characteristics and operate differently in terms of how they evaluate and select features. Here's how the Wrapper method differs from the\n",
    "# Filter method:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wrapper Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1. Model Performance-Based Selection:\n",
    "#   In the Wrapper method, the feature selection process is tightly integrated with the model training process. It involves using a specific \n",
    "#   machine learning algorithm to evaluate the performance of different subsets of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Feature Subset Exploration:\n",
    "#    The Wrapper method explores various subsets of features and assesses their impact on the model's performance. It tries different combinations\n",
    "#    of features and measures how well the model performs on a validation set or through cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Iterative Process:\n",
    "#    The process is iterative and involves training and evaluating the model multiple times for different feature subsets. This can be\n",
    "#   computationally expensive, especially for datasets with a large number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Model Performance Metrics:\n",
    "#   The performance metrics used to evaluate the model's performance can include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, etc., \n",
    "#   depending on the problem's nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Feature Dependencies Considered:\n",
    "#    The Wrapper method takes into account potential interactions and dependencies between features, as the model's performance is directly\n",
    "#    affected by these interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Model Bias and Variance Impact:\n",
    "#   The Wrapper method considers both model bias and variance because it directly affects the model's performance on the validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. Suitable for Small Datasets:\n",
    "#    The Wrapper method is suitable for small to moderately sized datasets, as the computational cost of training the model for each feature \n",
    "#    subset can be high.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Filter Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Feature Ranking and Selection Based on Metrics:\n",
    "#   The Filter method ranks features individually based on statistical or scoring metrics without considering the performance of a specific model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. No Model Training Involved:\n",
    "#   Unlike the Wrapper method, the Filter method does not involve training a machine learning model. It evaluates features independently of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Fast and Efficient:\n",
    "#   The Filter method is computationally efficient, making it suitable for larger datasets. It's a one-time process that doesn't require multiple \n",
    "#   iterations of model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Feature Independence:\n",
    "#   The Filter method does not consider feature interactions or dependencies; it evaluates features based on their individual characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Initial Feature Screening:\n",
    "#   The Filter method is often used as an initial screening process to quickly identify potentially relevant features. However, it might not \n",
    "#   capture complex relationships between features.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Less Prone to Overfitting:\n",
    "#   Since the Filter method doesn't involve model training, it's less prone to overfitting the model to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In summary, the key difference between the Wrapper method and the Filter method lies in how they evaluate and select features. \n",
    "# The Wrapper method directly integrates feature selection with model performance, while the Filter method ranks features based on standalone\n",
    "# metrics. Both methods have their strengths and limitations, and the choice between them depends on the problem's complexity, dataset size, \n",
    "# and computational resources available."

    "# that have built-in mechanisms to penalize or eliminate irrelevant features. Here are some common techniques used in embedded \n",
    "# feature selection methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Lasso (L1 Regularization):\n",
    "#   Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) adds a penalty term to the loss function during model training. \n",
    "# This penalty term encourages the model to set the coefficients of irrelevant features to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "# Lasso is especially effective when dealing with high-dimensional datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization):\n",
    "#   Ridge regression adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the coefficients of the features. \n",
    "# While Ridge does not perform explicit feature selection like Lasso, it can help mitigate the impact of irrelevant features by shrinking \n",
    "# their coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Elastic Net:\n",
    "#   Elastic Net combines L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization, providing a balance between feature selection and regularization.\n",
    "#  It's useful when there are correlated features in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Decision Tree-based Feature Importance:\n",
    "#   Decision tree-based algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) provide feature importance scores during training. \n",
    "# Features with low importance can be pruned from the model. Random Forest's feature importance and XGBoost's feature importance are commonly\n",
    "# used for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "#5. Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV):\n",
    "#   RFECV is a wrapper method that recursively eliminates features and performs cross-validation to determine the optimal number of features. \n",

    "# 8. Forward and Backward Selection with Neural Networks:\n",
    "#   In neural networks, you can perform forward selection (adding one feature at a time) or backward selection (removing one feature at a time)\n",
    "#   by monitoring the impact on model performance.\n",
    "\n",

    "# 4. Initialization and Iteration:\n",
    "#    Start with an empty set of selected features. In each iteration, add or remove one feature and evaluate the model's performance.\n",

    "# 5. Feature Subset Evaluation:\n",
    "#    Train the chosen machine learning algorithm using the training dataset and the current subset of selected features. Evaluate the model's\n",

    "# 6. Iteration Criteria:\n",
    "#    Decide on a criterion for adding or removing features. Common approaches include:\n",
    "#    - Forward Selection: Start with an empty set and iteratively add the feature that improves model performance the most.\n",
    "#    - Backward Elimination: Start with all features and iteratively remove the feature that has the least impact on model performance.\n",

    "# suitable algorithm, define appropriate iteration and stopping criteria, and interpret the selected features to ensure that the chosen feature\n",
    "# subset aligns with your understanding of the factors influencing house prices."
