    "# Question 1\n",
    "# Multiprocessing in Python\n",
    "# Multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to support more than one processor at the same time.\n",
    "# Applications in a multiprocessing system are broken to smaller routines that run independently.\n",
    "# The operating system allocates these threads to the processors improving performance of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "# usefulness of mutlithreading: -\n",
    "# Performing multiple operations for a single processor becomes challenging.\n",
    "# As the number of processes keeps increasing, the processor will have to halt the current process and move to the next, to keep them going.\n",
    "# Thus, it will have to interrupt each task, thereby hampering the performance.\n",
    "# In multiprocessing, the system can divide and assign tasks to different processors.\n",
    "# A multiprocessing system can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. A system with more than a single central processor\n",
    "# 2. A multi-core processor, i.e., a single computing unit with multiple independent core processing units"

    "# Question 2\n",
    "# Differences between Multiprocessing and Multithreading: -\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Concept - Multiprocessing : Multiple processors/ CPUs are added to the system to increase the computing power of the system.\n",
    "#            Multithreading : Multiple threads are created of a process to be executed in a parallel fashion to increase the throughput of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Parallel Action - Multiprocessing : Multiple processes are executed in a parallel fashion.\n",
    "#                      Multithreading : Multiple threads are executed in a parallel fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Categories - Multiprocessing : Multiprocessing can be classified into symmetric and asymmetric multiprocessing.\n",
    "#                 Multithreading : No such classification present for multithreading.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Time - Multiprocessing : Process creation is time-consuming.\n",
    "#           Multithreading : Thread creation is easy and is time savvy.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Execution - Multiprocessing : In multiprocessing, many processes are executed simultaneously.\n",
    "#               Multithreading : In multithreading, many threads are executed simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Address space - Multiprocessing : In multiprocessing, a separate address space is created for each process.\n",
    "#                    Multithreading : In multithreading, a common address space is used for all the threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. Resources - Multiprocessing : Multiprocessing requires a significant amount of time and large number of resources.\t\n",
    "#                Multithreading : Multithreading requires less time and few resources to create."
